Use the `g++ -o outName main.cpp functions.cpp functions.h -lm` command to try it out.

This is a command for the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) to compile and link a C++ program. Here's an explanation of each argument:

1. `g++`: This is the name of the GCC compiler for C++. It is used to compile and link the source code files and generate an executable file.

2. `-o`: This is an option to specify the name of the output file that will be generated by the compiler. In this case, `exeName` is the name of the executable file that will be generated.

3. `main.cpp`: This is the name of the main source code file that contains the `main()` function.

4. `functions.cpp`: This is the name of the source code file that contains the implementation of the functions declared in `functions.h`.

5. `functions.h`: This is the name of the header file that contains the declarations of the functions that are defined in `functions.cpp`.

6. `-lm`: This is an option to link the math library (`libm`). It is used to provide the math functions used in the program, such as `sqrt()`, `sin()`, and `cos()`.

Overall, this command compiles the C++ source code files (`main.cpp` and `functions.cpp`) and links them to generate an executable file (`outName`). The header file (`functions.h`) is included to provide the function declarations to the compiler. Finally, the math library is linked to provide the required math functions.

Obs: **namespace** stuff as well
